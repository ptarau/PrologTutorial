### Logic and Problem Solving with Prolog

We start with a short history of Prolog and its origins in using logic as a problem solving tool. After introducing  the unification algorithm and its use for Horn clause resolution, we describe Prolog's backtracking-driven answer search mechanism via a small meta-interpreter and a sketch of its Python equivalent.

After a short discussion of Prolog's control-structures and dynamic database operations, we put Prolog at work by solving efficiently a few interesting problems among which a Sudoku problem generator and solver, a compact type inference algorithm for simply-typed lambda terms and a theorem prover for intuitionistic propositional logic.

After introducing Prolog's definite clause grammars and their applications to natural language processing, we overview  state-of-the-art Prolog systems and their extensions among which tabling, constraint solving, multi-threading and co-routining mechanisms.

We conclude with a reflection on future evolutions of Prolog and  its descendent logic programming languages, with focus on neuro-symbolic mechanisms for building knowledge-driven deep-learning systems.
